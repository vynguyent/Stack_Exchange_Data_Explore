# Stack_Exchange_Data_Explore

#### Database 
The whole database of StackExchange can be found <a href="https://archive.org/details/stackexchange">here</a>. 
After I downloaded the 7z file, I unziped it and use the script "to_mongo.py" to save it into a mongodb database. 
If you are using PyCharm, there is a awesome plugin for mongodb which is called "mongo4idea". You can download <a href="https://github.com/dboissier/mongo4idea/raw/master/snapshot/mongo4idea-0.8.0-idea2016-distribution.zip">it</a> from <a href="https://github.com/dboissier/mongo4idea">mongo4idea</a> and put it under the "PyCharm Community Edition\plugins" directory.
